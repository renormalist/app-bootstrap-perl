NAME
    App::Bootstrap:Perl - Bootstrap Perl inclusive CPAN from git

=head1 ABOUT

The script bootstraps Perl installations inclusive a CPAN environment
from git.

It was originally developed to be used by Benchmark::Perl::Formance
but now lives on its own.

It should work for Perl versions from 5.8.x to blead. For 5.8.x it
cherry-picks a few patches to fix some known build issues.
